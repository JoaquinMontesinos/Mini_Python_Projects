# What are Lissajous Curves ?

A Lissajous curve , also known as Lissajous figure or Bowditch curve , is the graph of a system of parametric equations which describe complex harmonic motion.

# Practical Applications of Lissajous Curves :

* A Lissajous curve is used in experimental tests to determine if a device may be properly categorized as a memristor. It is also used to compare two different electrical signals: a known reference signal and a signal to be tested.

* Lissajous figures were sometimes displayed on oscilloscopes meant to simulate high-tech equipment in science-fiction TV shows and movies in the 1960s and 1970s.

* Lissajous curves can also be generated using an oscilloscope.
