## How it works?

- In this program we import ```pyttsx3```  and use this library. 
-  ```pyttsx3``` is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python.
- Wherever you see use of py3.speak before sentence, that sentence will be outputed in audio form.
- The program will ask you to input some command based on the options shown you on the screen.
- If your input is valid according to the program then output will be shown.
- If your input is not valid according to the program then ```"Sorry we do not suppport your specified choice"``` output will be shown.

### This is how Program will look like upon running.
