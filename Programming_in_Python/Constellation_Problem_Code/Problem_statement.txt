Three characters { #, *, . } represents a constellation of stars and galaxies in space. 
Each galaxy is demarcated by # characters. There can be one or many stars in a given galaxy.
Stars can only be in the shape of vowels { A, E, I, O, U }. A collection of * in the shape of the vowels is a star. 
A star is contained in a 3x3 block. Stars cannot be overlapping. The dot(.) character denotes empty space.

Given 3xN matrix comprising of { #, *, . } character, find the galaxy and stars within them.

Constraints:
3 <= N <= 10^5

Input:
Input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of columns.

Output:
The output contains vowels (stars) in order of their occurrence within the given galaxy. The galaxy itself is represented by the # character.
